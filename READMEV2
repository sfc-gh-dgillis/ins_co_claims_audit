That's a great starting point! A README should be clear, concise, and easy to skim. Here's a revised version that uses better structure, formatting, and clearer language to make it more readable.

## 🛡️ Insurance Claims Agent Demo

This repository showcases a powerful insurance claims agent built using **Snowflake Cortex** services. It processes claims data, handles both structured and unstructured information, and allows users to gain insights through pre-defined and free-form questions.

### ✨ Key Features & Technology

This demo leverages the following Snowflake tools to deliver an intelligent claims processing solution:

* **Snowflake Cortex Analyst, Search, AI SQL, and Agents:** Used for sophisticated data analysis and query generation.
* **Snowflake Intelligence:** Enables users to ask complex questions about claims.
* **Multimodal Analysis:** Describes and compares claims images with the claim description to verify if **supporting evidence aligns with the reported incident**.

### 🔗 Data Integration

A core capability is the ability to join **unstructured** and **structured** data, providing a complete view of each claim.

* **Structured Data:** Claims, financial transactions, and authorization records.
* **Unstructured Data:** Claim file notes, state insurance guidelines, invoices, and call transcriptions.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the demo.

### Step 1: Initialize Database Objects

1.  Run the `setup.sql` file. This script creates the necessary database objects:
    * **Database:** `ins_co`
    * **Schema:** `loss_claims`
    * **Stage:** `loss_evidence`
    * **Tables:**
        * `Claims`
        * `Claim Lines`
        * `Financial Transactions`
        * `Authorization`
        * `Parsed_invoices`
        * `Parsed_guidelines`
        * `Parsed_claim_notes`

### Step 2: Upload Evidence Files

1.  Upload the following files to the **`loss_evidence`** stage:
    * `1899_claim_evidence1.jpeg`
    * `1899_claim_evidence2.jpeg`
    * `Claim_Notes.pdf`
    * `Guidelines.docx`
    * `invoice.png`
    * `Gemini_generated_3.jpeg`
    * `ins_co_1899_call.wav`

### Step 3: Configure Cortex Analyst

1.  The setup script automatically creates a **`Models`** stage.
2.  Upload the following `.yaml` file to the `Models` stage:
    * `CA_INS_CO 8_20_2025, 4_52 PM.yaml`
3.  **Create a Cortex Analyst** using the uploaded `.yaml` configuration file.

### Step 4: Deploy the Interface

Choose one of the following methods for deploying the user interface:

#### Option A: Streamlit in Snowflake (Recommended)

1.  Create a new **Streamlit application** within the `ins_co` database and `loss_claims` schema.
2.  Paste the contents of the **`streamlit.py`** file into the Streamlit in Snowflake (SIS) editor.

#### Option B: Snowflake Intelligence Agent

1.  Create an **Agent** and use it directly within Snowflake Intelligence.
2.  Run the **Tools config**.
3.  Run the **Agents config**.

This version organizes the content into clear sections, uses bolding for emphasis, and formats the setup steps for easier execution.

Would you like me to refine the language further, or perhaps help you draft a compelling *project goal* statement for the top of the README?
